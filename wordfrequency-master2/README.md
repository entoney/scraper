Python scripts for Word Frequency

wordfreq.py - run this script in the Terminal with Python. It will ask for an input file (the txt file that includes your text) and an output file (what you want to name the file that will include the word counts).

wordfreq2.py - simpler script. You have to modify the filename at the end of the script with the filename that includes the text you want to analyze. It provides the word counts directly in the terminal.
